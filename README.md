This is just a fun exploration, seeing if I can capture a few learnings from the last 3 roles, each of which had a different frontend setup. Maybe we can merge some of these ideas together into a cohesive solution to use in the future.

- [x] Yarn Workspaces for Monorepo management
- [] Linaria for CSS
- [] Auth0 for Auth
- [] Prismic for Content Management
- [] NextJS for React Framework and Routing
- [] Vercel for Deployment
- [] Sentry for Exception Reporting
- [] Datadog for Performance and Event Reporting
- [] Apollo as a GraphQL Client
- [] Storybook to showcase the Design System
